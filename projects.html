		<p>My graducaiton project was on accident detection. The project should be able to identify an accident when it happens. In theory, we should use object detection, object tracking, and speed estimation to classify whether a given frame from a video feedback is an accident or not. But, what actually happened is that we just slapped all this information on the frame. For example, for the speed estimation we just slapped at the top left the output of the algorithm that we had no idea how it works. Everything in the project was pretrained or just used a library for it. This is the remake.</p>
